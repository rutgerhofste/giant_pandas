Cloud based Pandas approach for gigantic dataframes. Crunch numbers like a panda crunches a bamboo forest.




## Some Background
Data Scientists love Python and Pandas. SQL is a very powerful language but comepletely different from Python in syntax and approach. Wouldn't it be great if pandas could scale well and store results in large dataframes? The approach is simple, pandas syntax is translated into standard Google Bigquery SQL. 

Giant Pandas will use deferred execution for maximum performance.
